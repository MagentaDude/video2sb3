video2sb3 is an unofficial, client-side, free, and open-source web tool to turn videos into Scratch 3 projects.
### Why video2sb3?
Before video2sb3, you had to convert any videos you wanted to import into a GIF, and then import that into Scratch and wait a while. You also had to convert the video's audio into an MP3, import that, and create the playing code yourself... But that all changes with this tool, which converts your videos directly into a Scratch 3 project file for you, including compressed images, audio, and synchronized pre-made image-changing code!

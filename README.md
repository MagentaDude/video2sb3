video2sb3 is an unofficial, free, and open-source Python tool to turn videos into Scratch projects. [Try it out here!](https://github.com/MagentaDude/video2sb3/wiki/Using-video2sb3)
### Why video2sb3?
Before video2sb3, you had to convert any videos you wanted to import into a GIF, and then import that into Scratch (which was unreliable). You also had to convert it into an MP3, import that, and create the playing code yourself... But that all changes with this tool, which converts your videos directly into a Scratch 3 project file for you, including compressed images, audio, and pre-made code!
